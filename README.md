# Diabetes-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning pipeline to predict the risk of diabetes based on patient health data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, training multiple classification models, and evaluating their performance with key metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
