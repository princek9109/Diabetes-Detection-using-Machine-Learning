# Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning pipeline to **predict the risk of diabetes** based on patient health data.
The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, training multiple classification models, and evaluating their performance with key metrics such as **accuracy** and **F1-score**.

## Features

* Data cleaning and handling of missing values
* Feature engineering and normalization of health-related attributes
* Implementation of multiple classification algorithms
* Model comparison and evaluation using **Accuracy** and **F1-score**
* End-to-end ML pipeline for reproducibility

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Structure

```

```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/princek9109/Diabetes-Detection-ML.git
   cd Diabetes-Detection-ML
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Diabetes_detection.ipynb
   ```

## Results

* Trained and evaluated multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and others.
* Compared models using **Accuracy** and **F1-score** to identify the best-performing classifier.
* Achieved promising results for early-stage diabetes risk prediction.
