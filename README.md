# Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning pipeline to **predict the risk of diabetes** based on patient health data.
The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, training multiple classification models, and evaluating their performance with key metrics such as **accuracy** and **F1-score**.

## ⚡ Features

* Data cleaning and handling of missing values
* Feature engineering and normalization of health-related attributes
* Implementation of multiple classification algorithms
* Model comparison and evaluation using **Accuracy** and **F1-score**
* End-to-end ML pipeline for reproducibility

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
